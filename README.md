Arduino code for I2C protocol with interfacing strain gauges, HX711, and MPU6050. 
The updated slave device code is located in the "slaveDone" folder. 
The updated master device code is located in the "MasterDone" folder.

In order for these codes to work, you must import  the HX711 library and MPU6050 library to your Arduino IDE.

Our system consisted of 3 120 resistors, 1 120 ohm strain gauge, a metal bar and clamp, an MPU6050 accelerometer, 
a HX711 ADC/Amplifier, two Arduino Unos, and 3 LEDs.

The similar layout is shown in the fritzing application attached to this repository.
